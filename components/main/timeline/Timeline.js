              I first got involved in development back in my school days, when chats within the local area networks of the city, like{" "}

              , were popular. I became interested in how sites work and I tried to make my own and show it to other people on the network. It was the ugliest
              site in the world, built on three or four frames and used only HTML. However, at that moment, I realized that creating websites is very exciting.

              One of the chat participants praised me and told me to keep learning website development. He told me what I can do with PHP, gave me the{" "}

              The first large-scale project, as it seemed to me then, I completed at the university in 2012. It was a system of recording scientific
              publications. In it, I already used the CSS framework - Bootstrap, and used MySQL for data storage. Thanks to{" "}

              Having moved to a big city in 2015, I needed to find a job, but all I could do was develop quite a bit. That`s how I found my first job as a

              . There I first got acquainted with the PHP framework Yii. Thanks to wise mentors, I learned how to build complex queries in MySQL, write parsers,
              work with task trackers and work in a team.

              I left the first company because I didn`t see further growth. I tried to launch my own online sports equipment store, developed a website, an
              accounting system, and even sold a few products. But unfortunately it turned out that such goods are not in demand in our country. I started
              working full-time in an outsourcing company.

              I was offered a major freelance project related to advertising. I needed to develop a system that would download the product feed of an online
              store and sync ads, which sounded pretty simple. In fact, it turned out to be quite difficult. To begin with, I had to study Google Adwords well
              and all its limitations. There were a lot of products in the store, and one advertising campaign could contain a limited number of ad groups, and
              one ad group could contain quite a few ads. Using the Yii 2 framework, I wrote an automated system that created new campaigns, groups, and ads as
              needed. And also enabled or disabled the desired ads. It was not so much interesting as boring and problematic. I realized that this is not for
              me.

              I have been working for a long time on a mobile application that interacts with a hardware device, a smart inverter that collects information
              about the generation of electricity from solar panels. It was extremely interesting and difficult to understand the Modbus protocol and work with
              individual bytes of information. Especially when Bluetooth LE limited me in many ways. Unfortunately, funding for this project has run out.
            </p>
            <p>
              The new investor had his own development team and preferred that they continue developing the application. The problem was that they knew nothing
              about the hardware for which the application was made, nor about the existing application, nor about the technologies that were used in it. That's
              why I was hired as a consultant for this team (a consultant who also writes code).

            <p>
              During 9 months of working in an international company, I gained a wealth of experience in communication, mentoring other developers, and also
              looked at React Native from a different perspective.
